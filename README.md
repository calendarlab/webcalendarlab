# webcalendarlab
## a web calendar app similar to icalendar of icloud and based on caldavzap
Contrary to [caldavzap](http://www.inf-it.com/caldavzap/), we focused on best user-experience of calendar based on caldav protocol, and something happened as follows:

    1. the brand new user-interface and user-experience like icalendar in style
    2. add/remove/modify a calendar
    3. query /subscribe  a calendar
    4. share a calendar
    5. a event invited
    6. notification
 
 Now, we are refactoring it by working with vue.js
